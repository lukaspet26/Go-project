# sqaccess API plugin

The API plugin provides authentication (NOTE: not authorization) by username
and password as "middleware" to any requests.

It is a plugin to
the monolithic server [`github.com/mutablelogic/go-server`](github.com/mutablelogic/go-server) 
and as such the server needs to be installed in addition to the plugin. Instructions on how
to install the server and necessary plugins is described below.

This package is part of a wider project, `github.com/mutablelogic/go-sqlite`.
Please see the [module documentation](https://github.com/mutablelogic/go-sqlite/blob/master/README.md)
